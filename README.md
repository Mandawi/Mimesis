# Program: Mimesis
<br> A python program that translates sentences into descriptive images.
# Uses:
<br> - Uses google to search for images, and to translate into a wide variety of languages.
<br> - Helps young learners understand the meaning of words by showing them pictures.
# Future:
<br> This program is another step towards making an application that creates sketchnotes for any piece of writing. More on sketchnotes, here: https://sketchnotearmy.com/
# Current work:
<br> I am learning Flask to be able to make this a web application instead of having it run locally.
<br> I am working on making a slideshow html that outputs all the images so that there is no need for the user to go and locally display the pictures.
